# Older Changelog

### 0.0.5 (2026-10-26)

- Model field: a list of the models of the chosen provider, a model ID can still be typed in
- Fix: sendTo (e.g. `ask` from scripts, the model list) never reached the adapter, because `supportedMessages: {custom: false}` switched the message box off; the outdated key is removed from the instance at the first start, which restarts the instance once

### 0.0.4 (2026-10-26)

- Writes can require a confirmation with buttons in Telegram ("Confirmation required")
- New tool `remind_me`: reminders that survive restarts
- New tool `get_history`: past values from the history, sql or influxdb instance
- Token use and cost in `usage.*`
- Time zone setting: `remind_me` reads local times ("18:00", "27.10. 18:00"), answers and history are in local time, new tool `get_time`

### 0.0.3 (2026-10-26)

- Conversations are stored in SQLite instead of JSONL, which kept the whole history in memory
- Every conversation has its own queue: Telegram chats no longer wait for each other
- An answer that would give broken HTML is sent to Telegram as plain text; a quote in a link URL is escaped

### 0.0.2 (2026-10-25)

- Telegram answers keep their formatting: Markdown of the model is sent as Telegram HTML (bold, italic, code, links;
  tables as a monospace block), and Telegram chats are asked for short answers without tables
- Released through the CI workflow with npm provenance (trusted publishing)

### 0.0.1 (2026-10-25)

- Initial version: durable agent with the tools `search_objects`, `get_state`, `list_instances` and `set_state`
- Write allowlist and simulation mode; an interrupted write is never repeated; requests continue after a restart
- Telegram: talk to the agent through a telegram instance, with allowed users, prefix and one conversation per chat
- Providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek; every tool call is logged
